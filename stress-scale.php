     <h4>Perceived Stress Scale</h4>
     <h5>Instruction:</h5>
     <p>
     The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) helps us to understand how different situations 
     affect our feelings and our perceived stress. This is an adapted instrument from assessment
     developed in 1983 by Sheldon Cohen. the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used
     psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree
     to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. It is a classic stress assessment instrument. :

    <h5>Introduction</h5> 
    <p></p>
    <p>The items i.e. the questions in this scale are about your feelings and thoughts during the last month. 
    In each case, you will be asked to indicate how often you felt or thought a certain way. Although some of 
    the questions are similar, there are differences between them and you should treat each one as a separate question.
    The best approach is to answer fairly quickly and donâ€™t second guess yourself. For each situation think about your
    predominant reaction. 

    For each question choose from the following alternatives:

        <ul>
          <li>never</li>
          <li>almost never</li>
          <li>sometimes </li>
          <li>fairly often</li>
          <li>very often</li>
        </ul>

                Perceived stress incorporates feelings about the uncontrollability and unpredictability of oneâ€™s life, how often one has to deal with irritating hassles, how much change is occurring in oneâ€™s life, and confidence in oneâ€™s ability to deal with problems or difficulties. It is not measuring the types or frequencies of stressful events which have happened to a person, but rather how an individual feel about the general stressfulness of their life and their ability to handle such stress.

                in your life is most important. Consider the idea that two individuals could have the exact same events
                and experiences in their lives for the past month. Depending on their perception, total score could put
                one of those individuals in the low stress category and the total score could put the second person in
                the high stress category.
                You have a perception that you are on top of the situations in your space. It may also mean that you have let things run on their own and you are not bothered at all. Your low PSS score is not the same as the events in the last one month. It is shows that you chosen to see yourself not stressed. Hope this perception is not a carefree attitude.

                However, your score indicates you perceive to have high stress, and if you are truly, you might consider learning new stress reduction techniques as well as increasing your exercise to at least three times a week.  High psychological stress is associated with high blood pressure, higher BMI, larger waist to hip ratio, shorter telomere length, higher cortisol levels, suppressed immune function, decreased sleep, and increased alcohol consumption. These are all important risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
                You also think events around you are uncontrollable and going out of hands. You think life is  unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloading. You may need to get help in area of self-management. You think you are overwhelmed by the happenings in your space. It is important to have a feeling in your mind that you are in control. Control is first internal.  You may seek coaching to help you put things in proper perspective.
